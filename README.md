### Project Description
We have implemented a Memory Management System using C Programming Language. The Basic Working is as follows:

* There is a Main Chain List which points to a Sub-List of Memory Blocks holding Processes and Free Spaces in it. The Memory Allocated for every Main List Node is a Multiple of `PAGE_SIZE`. This has been implemented using a Doubly Linked List.

* Each Sub List Node can be a `Process` or a `Hole`: `Process` implies a Memory Block has a running Process, `Hole` implies Memory Block is Free.

* Whenever Memory for a new process is asked for, the Program checks through all the Free Spaces in the structure and if a Free Space with Memory Space enough for the process is found, the Free Space is divided into Process Space and a new Free Space (Remaining Space).

* If no such Sub List Node is found, a new Main List Node is created assigned with new Memory and contains a similar Sub-List.

* All memory allocations have been done using `mmap()` and `munmap()`.

### Functions in mems.h
* `void mems_init()`: Initializes all the required parameters for the MeMS system.
  - Input Parameter: Nothing
  - Reurns: Nothing

* `void mems_finish()`: Unmap the allocated memory using the munmap system call.
  - Input Parameter: Nothing
  - Returns: Nothing

* `void* mems_malloc(size_t size)`: Allocates memory of the specified `size` by reusing a segment from the free list if a sufficiently large segment is available. Else, uses the mmap system call to allocate more memory on the heap and updates the free list accordingly.
  - Parameter: The `size` of the memory the user program wants
  - Returns: MeMS Virtual address (that is created by MeMS)

* `void mems_free(void* ptr)`: Frees the memory pointed by `ptr` by marking the corresponding sub-chain node in the free list as `HOLE`. Once a sub-chain node is marked as `HOLE`, it becomes available for future allocations.
  - Parameter: MeMS Virtual address (that is created by MeMS)
  - Returns: nothing

* `void mems_print_stats()`: Prints the total number of mapped pages (using `mmap`) and the unused memory in bytes (the total size of `HOLE`'s in the free list). It also prints details about each node in the main chain and each segment (`PROCESS` or `HOLE`) in the sub-chain.
  - Parameter: Nothing
  - Returns: Nothing but should print the necessary information on `STDOUT`

* `void *mems_get(void*v_ptr)`: Returns the MeMS physical address mapped to `v_ptr` ( ptr is MeMS virtual address).
  - Parameter: MeMS Virtual address (that is created by MeMS)
  - Returns: MeMS physical address mapped to the passed ptr (MeMS virtual address).
